		<li>
			Unpack Entrada 1.0.0 with any upzip / untar program to your servers web-root. 
			The extracted directory will be named "entrada-1.0.0." or something
			to that effect; it would be a good idea to rename this extracted directory
			to "entrada" or whatever you would like your installation to be called.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			The following file and folders need to be writable by the user that your web-server
			and / or PHP runs as. This can generally be done through your FTP client
			such as Filezilla, Transmit, CuteFTP, and setting the permissions to 777.<br /><br />
			
			/entrada/www-root/core/config/config.inc.php<br />
			/entrada/www-root/core/storage/annualreports<br />
			/entrada/www-root/core/storage/cache<br />
			/entrada/www-root/core/storage/community-galleries<br />
			/entrada/www-root/core/storage/community-shares<br />
			/entrada/www-root/core/storage/event-files<br />
			/entrada/www-root/core/storage/logs<br />
			/entrada/www-root/core/storage/cache<br />
			/entrada/www-root/core/storage/user-photos<br /><br />
		
			Unix / Linux Web-Servers:
			Please chmod the storage directory to 777 using either your FTP client
			or by command line by entering "chmod 777 storage".<br /><br />
		
			Windows Web-Servers:
			On most Windows servers directories are already writable
			by the user in which your web-server runs; however, if they are not then
			you should be able to set this information by right clicking on the
			storage directory and allowing everyone to read / write data to it.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			While the Entrada setup program will create the database tables that
			Entrada needs to run, it will not create the actual databases for you, 
			therefore you will need to create 3 new databases ('entrada', 'entrada_auth' and 'entrada_clerkship') 
			and a user ('entrada') which has access to these databases.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			Point your web browser to the Entrada setup program located in
			the Entrada program directory and follow the on-screen instructions.<br /><br />
		
			Example: http://www.yourdomain.ca/entrada/setup/index.php<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li>
			After the installation has been completed, make sure you delete the
			setup directory from the Entrada directory root.
