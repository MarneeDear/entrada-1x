# Welcome to Entrada

## Entrada Overview

Entrada is an open source web-based platform created to allow teachers, learners
and curriculum managers a simple way of accessing, interacting, and managing the
curriculum within their educational environment. Entrada is ideally suited for
the health sciences because of its integrated curriculum tagging features and
clerkship support; however, it can easily be modified and adapted to almost any
professional program. The Entrada project is built upon the philosophies of open
access and collaboration, and we welcome new interest in the project.
